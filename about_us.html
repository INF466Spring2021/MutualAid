           <h2> Our Aims</h2>
            <p> Hello! This website was created in collaboration with Albany Law School and SUNY Albany.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to have one central place for all your mutual aid questions and needs. While this information can be found in other places online, there was no one place that had all of the information. This is where we come in. We have taken the time to put it together all the necessary information about mutual aid societies on one convenient website. </p>
            <br>
           <h2> Who we are</h2>
            <p> This project was supervised by Professor Brescia from Albany Law and Christopher Velez and Norman Gervais from SUNY ALbany.</p>
    
            <p> This website's content was created by Rory Butler and Amanda Hunter from Albany Law. The website's design was created by Jocelyn Chan, Zachary Taylor, and Katherine Amoresano from SUNY Albany. </p>

            <p> Thank you for taking the time to checkout our website!</p>
