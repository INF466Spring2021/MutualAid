           <h2> Our Aims</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this site is to have one central place for all your mutual aid questions and needs. While this information can be found in other places online, there was no one place that had all of the information. This is where we come in. We have taken the time to put together all the necessary information about mutual aid societies on one convenient website. </p>
