            <h2 id="identify" class="section">Identifying the issue</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>If you are considering starting your own Mutual Aid Society, chances are that you already have an issue in mind that you want to address, or a community you want to serve. When looking for additional members or volunteers for your group, it helps to have a clear, concise issue to address through the Mutual Aid Society.  Many of these groups form to provide mutual support through sharing of necessary items like food.  Other groups organize to help support those who might need emergency day care or help getting to or from a doctor’s appointment.  Some groups try to address lots of different community needs.  So, some questions to consider at the outset are what change you would like to see, what that change would look like, and what your visions are for the future of your Mutual Aid Society.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes an idea can grow beyond its original vision. In 1969, the Black Panthers started a free lunch program to prevent starvation in Los Angeles. By the following year, the program was feeding tens of thousands of children across several different cities. See <a href="https://www.history.com/news/free-school-breakfast-black-panther-party" target="_blank">https://www.history.com/news/free-school-breakfast-black-panther-party</a></p>
                    <p>Another thing to consider is whether a mutual aid organization or other, similar organizations already exists in your community to help meet the needs you want your group to address. If one does, it is worth asking what help they can use! See our map tool to determine if there is an already-existing Mutual Aid organization in the Capital District area: <a href="mutualaidnearme.html">Mutual Aid Near Me</a>.</p>
                    <p>Here is a list of resources your mutual aid society may decide to provide:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Childcare</li>
                        <li>Grocery shopping</li>
                        <li>Meal prep</li>
                        <li>Mental health checks and resources</li>
                        <li>Picking up medication for communities</li>
                        <li>Sharing tech/ internet resources</li>
                        <li>Utilizing specific skill sets by certain professionals</li>
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Providing medical advice</li>
                                <li>Providing counseling services</li>
                                <li>Assisting in filling out legal documents</li>
                                <li>Providing education on a certain area (such as education on safe sex)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Providing transportation to individuals without cars</li>
                        <li>Providing cleaning supplies</li>

                </div>
            <h2 id="askyourself" class="section">Ask yourself</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Each mutual aid society will have different ideologies, needs, approaches, and goals. It can be helpful to sit down with your members, or those who you want to help you form your group, and discuss what is important to your mutual aid society. Here are some questions to get you and your team started on the conversation. There is no one right answer to these questions, it all depends on what your group decides are your team’s goals.</p>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> How Far should our geographic reach be?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>The answer to this question will depend on the resources and goals of your mutual aid society. You could choose to organize by zip code, by block, a neighborhood, or by a specific distance (like all those who live in one square mile, or two miles from a particular point).</p>
                        </div>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> What resources do we have or need?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>Every mutual aid society has its own purpose and goal, so resources that you need or have may differ. By taking stock of your resources from the beginning of setting up your mutual aid society, you will be able to better ration and use your resources.</p>
                        </div>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> How can we build accountability?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>Because mutual aid societies often depend exclusively on community members donating their time, it can be difficult to produce a consistent schedule of volunteers who may have other commitments or irregular work schedules themselves outside of their volunteer efforts.  Some ways to build accountability include  having a signup sheet through excel or another format, check ins with volunteers a day or two before their volunteer shift, and/or have candid conversations with potential members about  the expectations for volunteers working with your group.</p>
                        </div>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> Should there be a limit on how much help we give one person/family?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>The purpose of a mutual aid society is to provide aid to your community. However, providing aid is dependent on your resources. One aspect to consider when structuring your mutual aid society is if you want to limit the amount of aid a household can receive. An example is providing groceries to elderly households. Some people believe it is not the mutual aid society’s role to say how much of something a household needs and that the purpose is to provide what the person needs, not what you think a household needs. However, others may think that in order to remain active, the mutual aid society has to limit the aid given.</p>

                            <p>Below are some ways to compromise, but remember what works for one mutual aid may not work for another:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Limit aid to once a week but don't limit how much of something that can be given</li>
                                <li>Limit aid by household</li>
                                <li>Only provide specific groceries (such as buying certain in bulk items and letting people pick out of those)</li>
                                <li>Separate mutual aid society into two purpose to fit both ideologies</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> Can a group sustain itself if its members have different ideological approaches to the provision of aid, the purposes behind the group, and the way the group operates?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>A mutual aid society can exist for numerous reasons and can take a wide range of approaches in how it functions. It is important to meet with your group and discuss what you want to do and how you want to do it. This discussion will bring up different ideologies and approaches and if so, it is important to determine if there can be a compromise or are the ideological differences so great that members should consider forming different groups.</p>
                            <p>Here is a list of questions that you should discuss with your key members:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>What are we providing (food, services, funds, education)?</li>
                                <li>Will we limit how much we will give one family?</li>
                                <li>Quantity or quality: if we want to help as many people as possible then buying in bulk may be the best option but if we want to provide fresh and organic food then we may not be able to help as many people.</li>
                                <li>Where does our community sphere end?</li>
                            </ol>
                        </div>
                </div>

                <h2 id="create" class="section">Creating a pod map</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Pod mapping is an excellent way to lay out and organize the individuals and resources they will provide within your pod. In the middle circle you will put the organizer of the organization. The solid circles will be people who help with the operation of the mutual aid society regularly. The dotted circles are individuals who have expressed interest to be included in your pod. The circles may be organized by the specific type of aid the person can provide. Watch our video on pod mapping for more information!  [Link to video]</p>

                <h2 id="findHelp" class="section">Finding help and volunteers</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Mutual aid societies are created through a social and collaborative approach. After it’s decided what issue your mutual aid society will tackle, you will begin to look for people who also want to tackle the same issue. This does mean not that everyone in the group will have the same views and experiences, but this can be beneficial as it allows for a conversation within the group and alternative approaches to the issue. There is a variety of ways to build your network. Some examples are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Social media (such as a Facebook group)</li>
                        <li>Emailing others in the area</li>
                        <li>Calling your neighbors </li>
                        <li>Distributing and posting fliers </li>
                        <li>Attending town hall meetings</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2 id="incorporate" class="section">What is Incorporating</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Incorporating a mutual aid society means that it is registered as a corporation in the state in which it will conduct its activities. If a mutual aid society conducts activities in more than one state, it is likely that the corporation would have to register in each of those states. Registering as a formal charity with the federal government will allow certain tax benefits to the mutual aid society. Charities registered with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code include entities that are “organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes. . . .” There are many benefits to registering as a formal non-profit entity with the IRS, including that donations to the group will be tax deductible for the donor, but there are also reporting and other obligations you must follow to qualify for and maintain 501(c)(3) status.  There is more information below on how to think about whether you might consider seeking recognition as a public charity.  As always, for more information you should consult an attorney and look at the IRS guidelines.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="miniquestion">What are the benefits of incorporating?</h3>
                    <p>Whether or not you want to seek recognition as a charity under IRS rules, you might want to consider forming a corporation generally.  If you do want to seek charity status with the IRS, you will have to incorporate.  But you do not have to pursue this charity status with the IRS.  That does not mean you might not want to incorporate.  This section addresses some of the questions that arise when you consider whether to incorporate.</p>
                    <p>Benefits of incorporating a mutual aid society includes:</p>

                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>While individuals or groups can be sued, incorporating an organization can protect directors from being held personally responsible for the actions of the organization and having to pay damages out of their own pockets.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>Incorporating has it perks. The two major ones are that donations made to the charity will be deductible on the donee's tax returns and (2) your organization will be tax-exempt. If the organization relies on donations, it could be an incentive to donee's that they can deduct their donation on their taxes. The concept of mutual aid revolves around the ideology of reciprocal help between individuals and community. Some people donate time and others may donate goods or money. If your mutual aid society registers as a 501(c)(3), tax payers who make donations can deduct the contribution on their tax return. See <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-contributions" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-contributions</a>.</p>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> The organization will earn revenue and might even make a profit:</button>

                            <p>501(c)(3) organization are tax exempt from the IRS. In order to be considered as a 501(c)(3) corporation, the charity has to be “organized and operated exclusively” for one or more of the statutes acceptable reasons, including charitable, scientific, literary, and educational purposes. The statute further requires “no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. . . .” IRC 501(C)(3).  In other words, no director, officer, or private individual, unfairly benefit from the activities or net earnings of the mutual aid society or any other 501(c)(3). Your organization may still make a profit though as long as that profit is furthering the organization’s verified purpose and not a shareholder or private person. In many cases a 501(c)(3) may need revenue in order to pay for certain goods and services. This may not be a concern for your organization if you mainly rely on donations and volunteers.

                    <p>It is important to note that not every organization can incorporate as an organization recognized as a 501(c)(3) charity. Organizations must have a general benefit to the public in order to qualify as a 501(c)(3) corporation. What does this mean? Your mutual aid society can limit itself to a small group or community, but the more exclusive the organization is on giving aid, the less likely it will qualify for 501(c)(3) status. Here are a few scenarios:</p>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> My neighbor is sick and some neighbors and I are collecting money for her, can we register as a 501(c)(3) with the IRS?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>This is generally not the type of organization that can qualify for 501(c)(3) states, however your state may have its own fundraising rules and registration requirements to comply with. See example: <a href="https://www.charitiesnys.com/faqs_reg_new.html" target="_blank">https://www.charitiesnys.com/faqs_reg_new.html</a>.</p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="ui-icon ui-icon-triangle-1-e"></i> Because of Covid 19, school has been remote, so a few parents and I have been taking turns watching each other’s children, can we register with the IRS and qualify for 501(c)(3) status?</button>
                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>Most likely no because of the exclusivity of the activity. If the aid was available more publicly to the community instead of just a narrow group of people, this may qualify.

                            <p>This may qualify as a 501(c)(3) corporation. While this is similar to the prior example, it is different in that it is available to the public of the school district. The inclusivity of the endeavor makes it more of a community effort than small group of parents or friends supporting each other.

                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>Mutual aid societies are not new and during times when a particular hardship or issue is devastating communities, more mutual aid societies tend to pop up. Some mutual aid societies are more permanent because they are tackling an issue that is not likely to go away in the near future. An example of this is an organization that tackles the problem of child hunger by providing lunches to children on weekends and school vacations. Other mutual aid societies tackle a problem that is most likely temporary. An example of a mutual aid society with a temporary objective is a mutual aid society that provides groceries to populations that are most vulnerable to COVID-19.</p>

                        <div class="collapsibleContent">
                            <p>Some individuals and groups hold the belief that registering with the state contradicts the essence of what makes mutual aid societies different from other nonprofit organizations and charities. Mutual aid is used to fill in the gaps left by state and federal aid, laws, and programs. Not only do mutual aid societies provide assistance to their community, they also provide education and space for difficult conversations. Mutual aid societies often take positions that challenge the government’s response to social issues that many people face, such as offering support to the LQBTQ+ community. Mutual aid societies are built on a social structure of neighbors helping neighbors and there is a fear that by incorporating, mutual aid societies would lose some of their ability to adequately oppose or question the government’s response to various social issues.</p>

                            <p>It can be difficult to know what you need to do to incorporate, especially because different states can have drastically different requirements for incorporating depending on that state’s law. Knowing where to find a state’s rules for incorporating can be confusing and time consuming. One place to start is by looking at your state government webpage. It can be helpful to consult an attorney who is well versed in your state’s nonprofit law and guidelines when completing the incorporating process.</p>

                                <p>There are many different ideological approaches to starting and running mutual aid societies. One popular view and use of mutual aid societies is that they are anti-establishment and/or take a stand against the government’s actions or response to different social issues. Some fear that having a board of directors can undermine an egalitarian ideology because instead of everyone being on equal footing, the voices on the board may be heard louder than others. Some mutual aid societies have addressed this by carefully drafting their bylaws and articles of incorporation in a way that ensures the collaborative environment. Another way to preserve the essence of a mutual aid society is through transparency. Depending on the size and reach of your mutual aid society, you may have a website explaining the organization’s purpose and goals. By explaining openly and outlining any board, council, or committee that the mutual aid establishes, it is easier for others not in those positions to understand the entities purpose and effect on the organization.
