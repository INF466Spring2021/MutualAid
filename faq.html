            <h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>

            <h3 class="miniquestion">Q: Do I have to incorporate my mutual aid society right away?</h3>
                <p>A: No. If while operating your mutual aid society you decide to incorporate you can do so despite being active prior to incorporating. However the benefits of incorporation will not apply retroactively to activities prior to incorporation.</p>

            <h3 class="miniquestion">Q: Do I have to have a Board of Directors?</h3>
                <p>A: If you are incorporated then you will need to have a board of directors. If you are not incorporated then you will not be required to have one.</p>

            <h3 class="miniquestion">Q: Do I have to have a conflict of interest policy?</h3>
                <p>A: The IRS does not require having a conflict of interest policy, but it is recommended, especially if your organization has 501(c)(3) status. See conflicts of interest section for more information.</p>

            <h3 class="miniquestion">Q: How can I join or volunteer for a mutual aid society?</h3>
                <p>A: A lot of mutual aid groups form informally and by word of mouth. Many groups make Facebook groups or put up posters at community bulletin boards.</p>
